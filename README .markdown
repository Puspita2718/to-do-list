# Enhanced To-Do List Application

A modern, responsive to-do list application with task organization by month and day, theme toggling, and localStorage persistence.

## Features
- **Task Management**:
  - Add tasks with a description, time, month, and day.
  - Tasks are organized by month in collapsible sections.
  - Mark tasks as important for highlighting in a separate section.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark modes with CSS variables for a seamless user experience.
- **View Toggle**: Switch between list and grid views for task display (partially implemented in CSS).
- **LocalStorage Persistence**: Tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage for persistence across sessions.
- **Search Bar**: Placeholder for task filtering (not yet functional).
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes with a clean, modern UI.
- **Custom Styling**: Uses CSS variables for consistent theming and a professional look with box shadows and rounded corners.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or Download Files**
   - Ensure you have the following files in the same directory:
     - `index.html` (main HTML structure)
     - `style.css` (styling for the app and themes)
     - `script.js` (JavaScript for task management and theme toggling)
     - `README.md` (this documentation file)

2. **Host the Application**
   - Host the files on a web server (e.g., VS Code Live Server, XAMPP, or Node.js with `npx http-server`) to ensure proper functionality.
   - Alternatively, deploy to a hosting service like Netlify or Vercel.
   - **Note**: Opening `index.html` directly in a browser (using `file://`) may work but could cause issues with localStorage or CSS rendering.

3. **Dependencies**
   - No external dependencies are required beyond a modern web browser.
   - The app uses Arial as the primary font with system fallbacks.

4. **Run the Application**
   - Open the hosted URL or local server address in a browser.
   - The to-do list interface loads with existing tasks (if any) from localStorage.

## Usage
- **Add a Task**:
  - Enter a task description in the "Task" input field.
  - Select a time using the time input.
  - Choose a month and day from the dropdowns.
  - Click "Add Task" to save the task.
- **View Tasks**:
  - Tasks are displayed in month-based sections and, if marked as important, in the "Important Tasks" section.
  - The grid view toggle button is present but requires additional JavaScript for full functionality.
- **Toggle Theme**:
  - Click "Toggle Theme" to switch between light and dark modes.
- **Search Tasks**:
  - The search bar is a placeholder for future filtering functionality.
- **Persistence**:
  - Tasks are automatically saved to localStorage and persist across browser sessions.

## Files
- `index.html`: HTML structure for the to-do list interface.
- `style.css`: Styling for light/dark themes, task sections, and responsive design.
- `script.js`: JavaScript for task creation, rendering, localStorage, and theme toggling.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Notes
- **Incomplete Features**:
  - The grid view toggle (`Switch to Grid View`) is styled but not fully implemented in JavaScript.
  - The search bar is a placeholder and requires additional logic for filtering tasks.
  - The important task toggle is defined in the task object but not yet user-configurable via the UI.
- **Styling**:
  - Uses CSS variables for consistent theming (light/dark modes).
  - The app is responsive, with a maximum width of 900px and flexible layouts for smaller screens.
- **LocalStorage**: Tasks are stored as a JSON array in localStorage under the key `tasks`.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Works in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Troubleshooting
- **Tasks Not Saving**: Clear localStorage (`localStorage.clear()` in browser console) if issues persist, then re-add tasks.
- **Grid View Not Working**: The grid view toggle requires additional JavaScript to switch layouts (not implemented in provided code).
- **CSS Issues**: Ensure `style.css` is correctly linked in `index.html` and hosted on a server to avoid rendering issues.
- **Theme Not Switching**: Verify the `theme-toggle` button's event listener in `script.js`.

## Future Improvements
- Implement grid view functionality for task display.
- Add search functionality to filter tasks by keyword.
- Enable marking tasks as important via a checkbox in the task input form.
- Add task deletion and editing capabilities.
- Include task completion status with checkboxes.
- Enhance animations for task addition and theme transitions.
